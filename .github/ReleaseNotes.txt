This version works with version 0.13.9.1.27050. It will still require a deobfuscated Assembly-CSharp dll which is included in each release.

**How to install**
- It is preferred that you install these releases automatically, using the [Stay in Tarkov Launcher](https://github.com/paulov-t/SIT.Launcher/releases)

OR 

- To install BepInEx dlls, you must first install BepInEx. [Follow the tutorial here to do so.](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
- Copy the *.dll to the BepInEx plugins directory
- Copy Assembly-CSharp to your "emulated tarkov" game's EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed directory *this may downgrade your version*
- Launch game through launcher or batch file
